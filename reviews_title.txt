Pile of nonsense thrown at you.
Worst Movie!!! Shocking.
A good thriller film of a pregnant woman.
Expected More But Okayish.
DIRECTOR WASTED HIS GOLDEN CHANCE.
Fantastic.
Good one.
Thriller ends with a mother Love.
One time watchable.
Another time waste thriller.
Only watch for one time.
Totally unrealistic.
Dumb movie.
Total Garbage! Save your time not watching it.
Feel the pure pain and agony why you are watching this movie.
Despite a compelling lead performance from Keerthy Suresh, the storyline is too stupid to warrant a watch.
